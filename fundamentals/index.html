            <p>The holy grail layout is a layout model commonly used in web design. It features a header area at the top of the page and a footer area at the bottom, spanning the full window width. Between the header and footer are three areas of equal height. The main body of content occupies the center area, with two panels of supporting content or interface elements on either side.</p>

            <h2>The Quest</h2>
            <p>In AD 932, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, travel throughout Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. He recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, along with their squires and Robin's minstrels. God (an image of W. G. Grace) appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail.</p>

            <p>Shhh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride... to Camelot. Who are you? But I don't like her. Where could we find this cave, O Tim? Yes, my liege! Welcome gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax. Come on! You just stay here, and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room. All right? It could be carried by an African swallow! I'm warning you!</p>
            <p>Oh, please! Stop that, stop that! You're not going to do a song while I'm here. Now listen lad, in twenty minutes you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain. [tap-dancing] Man! Back to your bed! What is your name? Well, um, can we come up and have a look? His head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off, And his penis-- What is that? We have the Holy Hand Grenade.</p>

You must tie her down on a bed and spank her! It's only a model. Burn her! Witch! Witch! Burn her! What is your quest? Oh, well, excuse me, I-- Halt! Hallo! Hallo! Oh, thank you, splendid, fine. [boom pweeng boom boom] Does wood sink in water? Look, I'm fine!</p>
            <p>Cut that out, cut that out. Look, you're marryin' Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea. [smack] Guards! Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get 'im. Ah. What seems to be the trouble? What? What an eccentric performance. Right. Oh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if we...
